Society’s increasing dependence on technology to transfer information is demanding new understanding as to how information transmission can be made more secure. This is clearly seen in the rise in issues surrounding data security and hacking, most recently illustrated in the December 2014 Sony hacks. Computers typically send many packets of information back and forth when communicating, allowing unwanted third parties to intercept and ‘steal’ some of them without being noticed. If it was possible to bundle packets together into single photons, it would be easier to tell if someone was tampering with them en route. Quantum dots are nanometer-scale particles engineered to exhibit tunable, size-specific fluorescence. Interactions between quantum dots and photons may provide a way to encrypt information securely within single photons. One of the important aspects of these interactions is the speed at which photons are emitted from an array of nanoscale particles. Working with researchers in Professor Hui Deng’s laboratory at the University of Michigan, I developed a program using Mathematica that models the interactions between photons and arrays of particles under a range of conditions. The program generates plots that show the probability of an input photon being released from the particle array at any point in time. This was designed to be used by the research team to explore conditions under which photon-particle array interactions potentially lead to unexpected or interesting results that may be useful to areas such as information encryption. The program was based on the work of Kozub et al. on short-range couplings between photons and quantum dot arrays (1). References1.  Kozub, M., Pawicki, L. and Machnikowski, P.
